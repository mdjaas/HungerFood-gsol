# HungerFood
Solution Challenge 2024

## Goal
Almost 224.3 Million or 16% of population in India go to bed hungry and nearly 828 million people go 
to bed hungry globally. Whereas one third of the food go to waste globally every day. Also about 15% of food is
lost even before leaving the farm due to lack of storage, unexpected heavy rainfall, drought, etc. To address 
this issue, we have created HungerFood.

## Project Description
Businesses throw away a huge amount food that are excess for the day. Similarly farmers lose their crops due to lack
of storage, unexpected rainfall, etc. 
HungerFood connects hungry customers to the businesses and to the farmers. Businesses can post the products
that are excess for the day at very low price or for free at the closing time.
For farmers we are using ML to predict the price they can expect from their crops for next 6 months. They can sell
their farm produce for lower cost if their crops are getting damaged and they can make informed decisions based
on prediction.

Hungry customers can buy food from restaurant, bakeries, groceries and crops from farmers at very low cost or for
free.

This solution prevents the wastage of foods at farmers and business level and at the same time it feeds the hungry
people. 

Hence this solution addresses the goal 'Zero Hunger' and 'Responsible consumption and Production' by enabling access
to food for hungry and preventing waste of food.
